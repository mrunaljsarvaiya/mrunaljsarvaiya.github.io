As President I was responsible for organizing and holding team meetings for over 60 students, both general as well as team leader meetings. My duties extended to managing the team budget and allocating the funds received across 6 subsystems while keeping a record of all trascations.</p> <p>As the external image of the team I developed and maintained relationships with corporate sponsors and the university. To increase public awareness about our team and the field of engineering in general, I organized and held external events such as outreach events at highschools, engineering openhouse booths and student recruiting events at the university.</p> <p>I succeeded in increasing student involvement from majors outside the engineering department, increasing sponsorship funding by 10% and created a new subsystem targeted towards Media and Business students.</p> <p><strong>Business and Sales Team 2016-2018</strong></p> <div class="row d-flex justify-content-center"> <div class="col-sm-14 mt-6 mt-md-0 d-flex justify-content-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/fsae/fsae_sales.jpg" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/fsae/fsae_sales.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 uniform-image-height" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>For this event each team makes a formal presentation to convince a panel of judges to invest in their race car business proposal. In this role play, the judges typically act as representatives of a fictitious manufacturing company. The competitors in this event will be judged on their ability to create and deliver a business case that convinces the judges that the team’s design best meets the demands of the amateur weekend competition market and that it can be profitably manufactured and marketed. The judges then score the presentation against predefined criteria , including the presentation content, quality of the presentation, its delivery, and the ability to defend the business proposal in the question and answer session.</p> <p>I was one of the two presenter for this event and was also actively involved in making the presentation and the market research behind it. Primarily I was responsible for coming up with a manufacturing scheme showing how and where all the products would be manufactured along with the associated machinery. I also gathered data to determine the yearly target sales and potential ways to convince buyers to pick our race car over others.</p> <div class="row d-flex justify-content-center"> <div class="col-sm-13 mt-6 mt-md-0 d-flex justify-content-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/fsae/fsae_sales_pose.jpg" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/fsae/fsae_sales_pose.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 uniform-image-height" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>My co-presenter and I have presented at 4 competitions so far.

After switching to a Yamaha R6 engine, there was a need to revalidate/redesign the intake and exhaust geometries of the car to optimize them for this new engine.​ GT-Power is a 2D simulations software that can be used to simulate an engine. The intake and exhaust geometries are modelled in to account for their effect on airflow and consequently their effect on the engine’s power output, efficiency, etc.By accurately modelling the engine and its associated components, each parameter can be altered to gauge how it affects the engine’s power output. Hence, the goal of this project was to observe how changing the intake’s runner length and exhaust tube lengths would affect the engine. Before parameter sweeps can be performed, the power curve predicted by GT-Power is to be compared to experimental data through the dynamometer to check the software’s accuracy.</p> <p>Simulations showed that changing exhaust lengths would not have any significant effect on the engine’s power curve. As for the intake, changing the runner length had a visible effect on the engine’s power output and it was changed from 160 mm to 220 mm to produce more power at the average RPM range of the car during autocross and endurance events.</p> <p>I am currently working on coupling Star CCM+ with the GT Power model to account for the complex 3D shapes of the intake manifold with a few other members. An Accurate model using Star will more strongly validate the accuracy of the model and allow analyzes different intake manifold designs as well.</p> </body></html>
