I have built [race cars](https://motorsports.illinois.edu/), developed algorithms for mobile manipulators that clean hotel bathrooms at [Peanut Robotics](https://www.peanutrobotics.com/), and recently joined a PhD program at [UC Berkeley](https://arplaboratory.github.io/) to explore the integration of Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning for aerial transportation systems.

People often ask me, "What made you pursue a PhD after developing planning and controls software for a robotics company for 4 years?" My intellectual curiosity bucket simply wasn't satisfied. I found myself craving the fulfillment I felt when I dove deep into a specific topic simply because it intrigued me. I wanted to immerse myself in a specific niche and spend the next few years filling up my curiosity bucket. Thatâ€™s what led me to pursue a PhD.

When faced with a decision with equally appealing options, such as starting a PhD program or continuing in the industry, I ask myself, "In 10 years, which choice will I regret not taking?" I knew for a fact that I'd regret not pursuing a doctorate.

#### What Do I Bring to the Table? 
<br>
$$ 
S = f_{\theta}(E, R, c)
$$

I have developed a context-dependent ($$c$$) skillset ($$S$$) that sets me apart from the average roboticist and researcher. My research capabilities ($$R$$) facilitate my ability me to dive deep into algorithm details, critically question the validity of proposed methods and persistently solve hard problems. Meanwhile, my engineering expertise ($$E$$) allows me to intuitively understand real world requirements and limitations, forsee failures and systematically account for these considerations during system development.

In the controlled environment of an R&D lab or startup, a robot success rate of 90% may suffice. To enable robots to operator in the **messy, unpredictable real world**, we need **99.99%**. I've optimized $$\theta$$ so that I can seamlessly transition to play the role of a research scientist, a robotics engineer and everything in between. I aspire to lead teams to close the remaining 9.99% gap and drive integration of reliable robots into our everyday lives.

#### What is my research about? 
<br>
I'm interested in developing deep learning methods to enable agile navigation in unstructured environments for aerial systems. My first two years were dedicated to building a high quality expert dataset by developing an algorithm that produces time-optimal trajectories in cluttered scenarios. The rest of my time will focus on using this data to develop policies that map onboard depth information to robot trajectories.
