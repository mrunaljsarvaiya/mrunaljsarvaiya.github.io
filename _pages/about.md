I've built [race cars](https://motorsports.illinois.edu/), developed algorithms that mobile manipulators that autonomously clean hotel bathrooms ([Peanut Robotics](https://www.peanutrobotics.com/)), and recently joined a PhD program at [NYU](https://wp.nyu.edu/arpl/) to explore the integration of Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning for aerial transportation systems.

People often ask me, "What made you pursue a PhD after developing planning and controls software for a robotics company for 4 years?" The answer is simple: my intellectual curiosity bucket wasn't satisfied. I found myself craving the satification that comes after spending days deep-diving into the technical details of a method, purely because it intrigued me. I wanted to immerse myself in a specific niche and spend the next few years filling up my curiosity bucket. Thatâ€™s what led me to pursue a PhD.

When faced with a tough decision with equally appealing options, such as pursuing a PhD or continuing in the industry, I ask myself, "In 10 years, which choice will I regret not taking?" I knew for a fact that I'd regret not doing a PhD.
