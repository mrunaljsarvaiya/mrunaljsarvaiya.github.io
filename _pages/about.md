I've built [race cars](https://motorsports.illinois.edu/), worked at [Peanut Robotics](https://www.peanutrobotics.com/), a Silicon Valley startup, to develop algorthms that allow mobile manipulators to autonomously clean hotel bathrooms, and I recently joined a PhD program at [NYU](https://wp.nyu.edu/arpl/) to explore the integration of Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning for aerial transportation systems.

People often ask, "Why do you want a PhD? Especially since you have four years of experience in building robot planning and control software in the industry?" My answer simply is that my intellectual curiosity wasn't fully satisfied. Developing solutions for real world robotics problems was exciting, but I found myself craving the satification you get after you read a good quality research paper or *actually* understand the inner workings of a MPC solver. I’m passionate about developing both the theoretical and practical intuitions behind these systems, and that’s what led me to pursue a PhD.

When faced with a decision with multiple viable options, I like to ask myself, "In 20 years, which path would I regret not taking?" I knew for a fact that I'd regret not doing a PhD.
