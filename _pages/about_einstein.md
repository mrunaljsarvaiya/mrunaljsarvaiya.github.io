Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I've built [race cars](https://motorsports.illinois.edu/), worked at [Peanut Robotics](https://www.peanutrobotics.com/), a Silicon Valley startup, to develop algorithms to enable mobile manipulators to autonomously clean hotel bathrooms, and I recently started my next adventure: joining a PhD program at [NYU](https://wp.nyu.edu/arpl/) to explore the integration of Model Predictive Control and Reinforcment Learning for aerial transportation systems.

People often ask, "Why pursue a PhD? Especially after four years as a robotics engineer, with plenty of experience building robot planning and control software?" My answer simply is that my intellectual curiosity wasn't fully satisfied. Developing solutions for real world robotics problems was exciting, but I found myself craving the satification you get after reading a high quality research paper or when you finally understand the inner workings of a MPC solver. I’m passionate about developing both the theoretical and practical intuitions behind these systems, and that’s what led me to pursue a PhD.

When faced with a decisiion with multiple viable options, I like to ask myself, "In 20 years, which path would I regret not taking?" I knew for a fact that I'd regret not doing a PhD.
