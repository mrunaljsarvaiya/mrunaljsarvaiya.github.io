I worked at Tesla, Inc. as an R&D Test Systems Engineering Intern. My work was focused on automating the motor testing system. The previous process involved manually running tests and collecting, analyzing and uploading the results. For my project, I integrated an automated software solution to replace this manual process saving both time and money. Here are the main highlights of my project:

- Developed a Python program that automated data logging and was deployed on over 20 workstations replacing hardware worth over $5,000 per dynamometer workstation
- Increased data accessibility and reduced post processing time by automating the data collection process using Jenkins workflows
- Streamlined the data collection process by automating data transfer and removing the need for user input
- Reduced complexity of non-standard test scripts by integrating python into the existing testing architecture
